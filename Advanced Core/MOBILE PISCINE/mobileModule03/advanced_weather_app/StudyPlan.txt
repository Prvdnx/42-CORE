To understand this project enough to reproduce it, you should study the files in a specific order that follows the flow of data and logic through the application.

### Step 1: The "Why" - Project Requirements

*   **File:** `subjects.txt`
*   **Purpose:** Before diving into the code, read this file. It explains the requirements for each module (`Module01`, `Module02`, `Module03`). This will give you a clear understanding of *why* the code is structured the way it is and what features were built in what order.

### Step 2: The "Brain" - Top-Level State Management

*   **File:** `App.js`
*   **Purpose:** This is the most important file. It's the root of your application and controls everything.
*   **What to study:**
    *   **State:** Look at all the `useState` hooks. Understand what pieces of information (like `selectedLocation`, `weatherData`, and `appState`) are being stored.
    *   **Data Flow:** Find the `loadWeatherData` function. See how it uses the `WeatherService` to fetch data and updates the state with `setWeatherData`.
    *   **Lifecycle:** Examine the `useEffect` hook. See how it calls `askForGeolocation` on the initial render to get the user's location.
    *   **Component Assembly:** Look at the `return` statement to see how it assembles the main components (`TopBar`, `PagerView` for the screens, and the bottom `tabBar`). Pay close attention to the props being passed down to each component.

### Step 3: The "Data" - Service Layer

*   **Directory:** `src/services/`
*   **Purpose:** These files are responsible for all communication with the outside world (APIs and device hardware). They isolate your data-fetching logic.
*   **Study Order:**
    1.  `LocationService.js`: The simplest service. See how it uses Expo's `Location` library to get the device's GPS coordinates.
    2.  `GeocodingService.js`: Understand its two jobs: finding city suggestions from a search query and getting a location name from GPS coordinates.
    3.  `WeatherService.js`: See how it takes coordinates and fetches the three different types of weather data (current, today, weekly) from the Open-Meteo API. Notice how the raw API data is transformed into a cleaner format for the app.

### Step 4: The "Tools" - Shared Utilities and Components

*   **Directory:** `src/utils/`
*   **Directory:** `src/components/`
*   **Purpose:** These are the reusable building blocks used to construct your UI and share logic.
*   **Study Order:**
    1.  `weatherUtils.js`: A perfect example of a simple, reusable utility function.
    2.  `WeatherScreenLayout.js`: A crucial component. Understand how it uses its props (`isLoading`, `error`, etc.) to decide whether to show a loading indicator, an error message, or the actual content. This component prevents a lot of repeated code in the screens.
    3.  `TopBar.js`: The most complex UI component. Study how it manages its own state for search suggestions, how it uses `useEffect` for debouncing search requests, and how it uses callbacks (like `onLocationSelected`) to send information back up to `App.js`.
    4.  `TemperatureChart.js` & `WeeklyTemperatureChart.js`: Look at these to see how you can encapsulate a specific piece of UI, like a chart, into its own component.

### Step 5: The "Pages" - Screen Components

*   **Directory:** `src/screens/`
*   **Purpose:** These files represent the individual screens for each tab.
*   **What to study:** Notice how simple these files are now. Their only job is to take the data passed down as props from `App.js` and render the specific content for that page. They delegate all the loading/error logic to `WeatherScreenLayout`.

Introduction

Chapter IV
Exercise 00: BottomBar
Exercise :
BottomBar
Turn-in directory : mobileModule01
Files to turn in : weather_app and all necessary files
Forbidden functions : None
In Module01, you will begin preparing your weather application. This application, like
all the others you will complete by the end of the Piscine, must be responsive.
To start, create a new project called weather_app.
Now, you will create the structure of your application with the following components:
- An AppBar that includes a search TextField and a geolocation button.
- A BottomBar with 3 tabs: “Currently”, “Today” and “Weekly”.
- Each tab should have its own content.
Your application must be responsive.
The BottomBar:
• Create a BottomBar with 3 tabs.
• Each tab should have a name and an icon (Currently, Today, Weekly).
• You should be able to switch between tabs by clicking on them or by swiping; both
methods should work.

Piscine Mobile - 1 Structure and Logic
• When you switch tabs, the content of the page should change. For now, simply
display the name of the tab as text, nothing more!
• When the application starts, the first tab (Currently) should be selected by default.
In Flutter:
Use the “TabBar” widget to create a TopBar with tabs.
Use the “TabBarView” widget to create the different views.
Use the “BottomAppBar” widget to create the BottomBar.

The TopBar:
• It includes a search TextField.
• It includes a geolocation button.
Both the TextField and the geolocation button should work correctly!
The application should display either the text entered in the TextField or the geolocation
data, depending on which one is used.
Details:
• If you enter text in the search TextField, the application should display the tab
name along with the entered text in all tabs.
• If you click the geolocation button, the application should display the tab name
along with the word “Geolocation” in all tabs.
At this stage, your application should look like the following basic layout:

Specific Instructions
This module is a continuation of the previous one. For clarity, you will copy the project
from the previous module into a new repository to continue working on it.

Chapter III
Introduction

Chapter IV
Exercise 00: Where are we?
Exercise :
Where are we?
Turn-in directory : mobileModule02
Files to turn in : medium_weather_app and all necessary files
Forbidden functions : None
In the previous module, you created a weather app that currently displays a simple text.
Now it’s time to add real data to your app.
To achieve this, you will need:
• A weather API.
• Geolocation using the device’s GPS.
• A Geocoding API to retrieve the city name from the coordinates.
Start by implementing geolocation.
When the application starts or when the user clicks a geolocation button, you need to
determine the device’s location to fetch the weather.
Use the device’s GPS to get the coordinates.
This requires obtaining the user’s permission to retrieve and use their location.

Piscine Mobile - 2 API and Data Management
You must handle both cases: when the user grants permission and when they deny it.
• If the user grants permission, you will retrieve the coordinates and use them to
fetch the weather.
For now, just display the coordinates as text.
• If the user denies permission, your app should still function.
The user should be able to enter a city name in the search field to get the weather,
but they must be informed that you don’t have access to their location.
At the start of your application, you should have something like this:
You must not use an external API for geolocation; you are required to
use the device’s GPS to obtain the coordinates.

Chapter V
Exercise 01: Searcher
Exercise :
Searcher
Turn-in directory : mobileModule02
Files to turn in : medium_weather_app and all necessary files
Forbidden functions : None
You also have a search bar to get the weather by entering a city name, country, region,
etc.
You will use the weather API to get the weather.
You will also need the Geocoding API to obtain city names from coordinates or coordinates from city names.
When you query the API for weather by city name, you will often receive a list of
cities matching the name you entered.
You must display a suggestion list of cities, with each suggestion showing:
• The city name.
• The city’s region.
• The country of the city.
This will allow the user to choose the correct city.
The suggestion list should update dynamically as the user types in the search bar.
When the user selects a city from the list, fetch the weather for that specific city.
The user should also be able to search without selecting a city from the list.

Piscine Mobile - 2 API and Data Management
Your app should look something like this:
For this project, we will use:
• Geocoding API from Open-Meteo to get coordinates from city
names and populate the search list.

Chapter VI
Exercise 02: Fill the Views
Exercise :
Fill the Views
Turn-in directory : mobileModule02
Files to turn in : medium_weather_app and all necessary files
Forbidden functions : None
Now it’s time to populate the views with the data.
In your first tab “Current”, you need to display:
• The location (city name, region, and country).
• The current temperature (in Celsius).
• The current weather description (e.g., cloudy, sunny, rainy).
• The current wind speed (in km/h).
In your second tab “Today”, you should display:
• The location (city name, region, and country).
• A list of the day’s weather, showing:
◦ The time of day.
◦ The temperature at each hour.
◦ The weather description (cloudy, sunny, rainy, etc.) at each hour.
◦ The wind speed (in km/h) at each hour.
In your third tab “Weekly”, display:
• The location (city name, region, and country).

Piscine Mobile - 2 API and Data Management
• A list of the weather for each day of the week, including:
◦ The date.
◦ The minimum and maximum temperatures of the day.
◦ The weather description (e.g., cloudy, sunny, rainy).
Be mindful of the following points:
• When you run the application, it should start on the first tab “Current”.
• When you perform a search, you should remain on the tab where you initiated the
search.
• When switching tabs, always display the data from the last search.
For now, don’t focus on the design—just ensure that the information is displayed
correctly.
You will enhance the design in the next module.
Your app should look something like this:
For this project, we will use the following APIs:
• Weather Forecast API from Open-Meteo.

Chapter VII
Exercise 03: What’s wrong with
you?
Exercise :
What’s wrong with you?
Turn-in directory : mobileModule02
Files to turn in : medium_weather_app and all necessary files
Forbidden functions : None
Great job so far!
But there’s still more to be done.
You’ve already handled the case where the user denies location access, but there are
other situations to account for:
• The user enters a city name that doesn’t exist.
• The connection to the API fails.
In both cases, you must inform the user that the city name is invalid or that there
was a connection issue.
The message should remain visible until the user enters a valid city name or the connection
to the API is restored.
Never underestimate the user’s ability to break your application!
You must always be prepared to handle any edge cases.
Your app should display something like this:
