 Chapter II
Specific Instructions
To begin this module, you will create a new project app named “diary_app” in a new repository called “mobileModule04”.
This project will continue into the next module.
Your new application will be a diary app.
It will allow you to create, read, and delete diary entries. The diary will be protected by an authentication system.
All entries will be stored in a database.
In this module, your task is to set up the foundation of your application with an authen- tication system and database.

 Chapter III
Exercise 00: Login Page
     Exercise :
 Login Page
Files to turn in : diary_app and all necessary files
 Turn-in directory : mobileModule04 Forbidden functions : None
   Start by creating the login page. This page must include:
• A login button that either redirects to an authentication page or directly to the diary page if the user is already logged in.
• The option for the user to log in using a Google or GitHub account.
You must choose an authentication system where users can be stored and managed.
You may use an authentication system like Firebase, AWS, etc.

 Chapter IV
Exercise 01: Profile Page
     Exercise :
 Profile Page
Files to turn in : diary_app and all necessary files
 Turn-in directory : mobileModule04 Forbidden functions : None
   The next step is to create the profile page.
This page should only be accessible if the user is logged in.
The authentication system should redirect the user to this page after logging in, or di- rectly if they are already logged in.
Before creating the page, you will need to set up a database to store all diary entries.
In the database, you need to store: • The user’s email address.
• The date of each entry.
• The title of each entry.
• The user’s feeling of the day. • The content of the entry.

 Piscine Mobile - 4 Auth and Database The database structure should resemble this:
You must be able to create, read, and delete entries, so you need to implement the logic for these operations.
For now, create a profile page that includes:
• A list of all diary entries.
• A button to create a new entry.
• When a user taps on an entry, they should be able to read it. • A button to delete an entry.
When a new entry is created, the list must be updated. When an entry is deleted, the list must also be updated.

For the evaluation, you must create a Google account for your evaluator to test your app. Ensure that this account contains some diary entries.

 Chapter II
Specific Instructions
This project is a continuation of Module 04. You will need to implement a new feature in the application you have already developed. For clarity and to avoid confusion, copy your previous project into a new folder and continue working from there.
Your application must now have 3 pages:
• The first page is the login page, which should contain the buttons for login. • The second page is the profile page.
• The third page is the agenda page.
The app requires an internet connection to work.
